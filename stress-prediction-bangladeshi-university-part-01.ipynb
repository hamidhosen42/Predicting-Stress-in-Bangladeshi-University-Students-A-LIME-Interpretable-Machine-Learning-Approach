Recognizing the urgency to address this problem, our research paper employs machine learning algorithms and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to predict stress levels among university students. By accurately identifying stress levels and understanding the underlying factors, we can take proactive measures to minimize the negative impact on students' academic performance and well-being.\n\nThe study involved collecting data from multiple universities in Bangladesh, ensuring a diverse and representative sample. Various features, including academic performance, socio-economic background, lifestyle choices, mental health indicators, and self-reported stress levels, were considered as input variables. Machine learning algorithms were trained on this dataset to develop prediction models capable of accurately classifying stress levels in university students.\n\nAmong the machine learning algorithms evaluated, the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) emerged as the top performer, achieving an accuracy of 90%. This high level of accuracy underscores the potential of machine learning in effectively predicting stress levels. The SVC model incorporates a kernel function that separates stress levels based on different features, enabling robust classification.\n\nTo address concerns about model interpretability and biases, an explainable artificial intelligence technique called LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) was employed. LIME provides insights into the decision-making process of the machine learning model, allowing us to identify specific observations and features that significantly contribute to stress predictions. By applying the Lime method, the research team gained a deeper understanding of the model's behavior and ensured transparency and understandability in the stress prediction process.\n\nThe results of this research not only contribute to accurate stress prediction but also reveal the causes and factors contributing to stress among university students. By identifying at-risk individuals early on, universities and support services can implement targeted interventions and support systems tailored to the specific needs of stressed students. Furthermore, the interpretability offered by the Lime method enables stakeholders to address any biases present in the prediction model, ensuring fair and equitable support for all students.\n\nIn conclusion, this research paper demonstrates the potential of machine learning algorithms and explainable artificial intelligence techniques in predicting stress levels among university students. By utilizing the Support Vector Classifier and the Lime method, we achieved a high level of accuracy and transparency in stress prediction. The findings of this study not only assist in early detection of stress but also provide insights into the underlying causes. Through proactive interventions and support, we can mitigate the negative effects of stress on students' academic performance and overall well-being, fostering a healthier and more conducive learning environment.","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.048059,"end_time":"2023-09-19T03:05:43.134204","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-09-19T03:05:43.086145","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Importing the Libraries","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.047031,"end_time":"2023-09-19T03:05:43.229197","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-09-19T03:05:43.182166","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This section will give information about Python libraries to be used in the study and these libraries will be imported into the project.
